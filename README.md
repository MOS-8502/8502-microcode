# ⚙️ MOS-8502 Microcode / Control Logic

This repository stores the control logic (microcode) files for the MOS-8502 compatible CPU implemented in the https://github.com/MOS-8502/digital-logic-sim project. The microcode is crucial for decoding and sequencing the execution of the 8501/8502 instruction set.
